Ironhack Data Analyst SQL Project by Alejandro Figueroa, Bryan Frank, Danielle Steede, David Heller, Luis Millet, Vanessa Jimenez

# Project Overview
The magical world of Harry Potter is a rich tapestry of characters, spells, and intricate details about the lives of witches and wizards. This project focuses specifically on Hufflepuff House, aiming to uncover patterns and insights related to the blood status distribution and contributions to magical advancements within this house compared to Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

# Hypotheses 
Main hypothesis: The ratio of pure-bloods compared to other blood statuses (half-bloods and muggle-borns) is lower in Hufflepuff than in any of the other Hogwarts Houses.

Secondary hypothesis: Hufflepuffs creators are responsible for fewer spells and potions compared to the other houses.
houses.

# Analysis
Our Hypotheses were confirmed to be true. 

## Key Findings
Our analysis has shed light on the unique characteristics of Hufflepuff House within the Hogwarts community. 

Our main hypothesis, centered on Hufflepuff's dedication to inclusivity, has been substantiated by our findings. The data reveals a lower proportion of pure-bloods in Hufflepuff compared to other houses, with Slytherin presenting the highest concentration.

Furthermore, our investigation into the educational backgrounds of Hufflepuff members suggests that they commence their magical education with less exposure to the Wizarding World compared to their peers from other houses. This finding aligns with our secondary hypothesis, indicating that Hufflepuff students may have a different starting point in terms of magical experience, potentially impacting their ability to innovate new potions and spells.
