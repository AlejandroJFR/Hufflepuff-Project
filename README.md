# Hufflepuff-Project
Ironhack Data Analyst SQL Project by Alejandro Figueroa, Bryan Frank, David Heller, Luis Millet, Vanessa Jimenez

# Project Overview
Main hypothesis: The ratio of pure-bloods to other blood statuses (half-bloods and muggle-borns) is lower in Hufflepuff than in any other Hogwarts House
Secondary hypothesis: Hufflepuffs creators are responsible for fewer spells and potions than other houses

# Data Sets
We decided to use the [Potter DB: API](https://docs.potterdb.com/) to pull data on characterâ€™s houses, potions and spell effects and their creators
